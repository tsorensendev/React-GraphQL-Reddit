Tannit - A Reddit Clone

This is just an app made for fun to hone my skills.

The front end is made with React.js/ApolloClient, using JSS for styling
The back end is made with Node.js/Express.js, using MongoDB w/ Mongoose, GraphQL for querying and Passport.js for authentication

Setup after cloning the repository:

Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

Backend
```
cd backend
npm i
node app
```
